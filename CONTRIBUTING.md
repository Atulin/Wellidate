# Contributing
- Before you start writing a pull request you should discuss it using GitHub issues.
- Bug reports should be provided with at least minimum repro, if it works on [documentation page](http://nonfactors.github.io./Wellidate) you must be doing something differently, please analyze the core of the problem first and provide as much details as you can, best is a working js fiddle.
